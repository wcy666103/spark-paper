The Spark.tar package is a modified version of the source code that adds the physics plan, shuffle aggregation, and so on, as well as intermediate files from my experiments.

The hibench.tar package was used to generate the experiment data, and I modified the Hibench source code and added some personalization to capture the resource consumption of the experiment.

The pythonProject.tar package is a collection of scripts that I use to dynamically fetch experimental data by running resultful http requests.



Limited by the size of Github single file, training data and result set, please contact my email, and I will send them to you in the form of attachment.
